"Q9 - Please describe your teaching philosophy or approach in one or two sentences. It is ok if you've never taught, we'd still like to know what you think your approach would be."
Man
Please describe your teaching philosophy or approach in one or two sentence...
" College years or formative to the career choice of most students. Therefore, it is first fundamental that course is effectively convey why the subject is exciting and/or worth studying. Second, content and depth of the material needs to actively challenge students, yet at the same time he clearly presented and rely extensively an interactive and engaging learning  activities, such as applied problems. Finally, grading should be done in a way that tests very basic knowledge, but does not leave students who aren't ""in to"" the subject in fear of their academic standing. "
"Be as clear and patient as possible, be prepared for class"
experiential learning
"Bring up-to-date broad information in an accessible way to students and, in turn, require active learning through discussions, assignments, and/or term papers "

Be supportive and enthusiastic
"Inspire and challenge students to grow intellectually, think critically, and understand something about how the natural world around them works"
"I believe students should leave the class with a new way of seeing the world, with inspiration from the instructor, better tools to conduct their work, and a more constructively critical eye for tackling change."
"Highly interactive, involving students by asking many questions and fielding/discussing student responses."
"""Stimulating critical analytical and synthetic thought."""
"Do my best to provide students with the guidance they need in order to learn and retain the material. I also think it's very important to admit my own mistakes, and therefore be accepting of students' diligent effort even when its erroneous.  "
"To provide limited content of large bredth, but in doing so provide the student with the starting point for practicing/figuring the content out for themselves. "

"I like to challenge students to both master new material, but also make connections across disparate ideas that can be useful for developing their personal philosophies and strategies to problem solving"
"I make myself as available as possible, and I try my best to engage students and give them good help."

Woman
Please describe your teaching philosophy or approach in one or two sentence...
"Be a resource for students- aiding in understanding material and understanding how to do well in class "
"Remember students come from a variety of backgrounds...which means inspiring in different ways. If the student doesn't understand, it's because you haven't taught it well enough."
Learning is best done in an interactive environment by an enthusiastic teacher and needs to accommodate different types of learning styles. Clear expectations lead to less misunderstandings and better grading
"I believe that course content should be communicated using diverse, research-based methodologies that are sensitive to the needs and backgrounds of the students I teach.  Cultivating a positive classroom culture is critical to the success of students and functions best when it is based on collaboration among students, teachers, and TAs. "
"pushing students to excel at new skills, synthesis, integration of knowledge, application of knowledge"
It is important to have interactions with the students and flexibility in how the material is taught to account for different learning styles.
I outline very clear expectations for the quarter and check in with students often to be sure they are understanding the material.
"I want to be inspirational, and facilitate critical outside the box thinking in students."
"A blend of instruction and DIY experience (e.g. lab, project, field visits)."
Inquiry-based learning. Emphasis on critical thinking and ability to apply concepts over simple memorization.
Commit to providing quality education in the same way you want students to commit energy and thought to the class. Set high standards and hold yourself to them as an example.
My goal is to engage students and share my knowledge in a way that is interesting to them. I also like to engage them during class by asking questions and doing exercises to break up lecture.
I prefer to teach by mixing review and student engagement through questions.
"I believe that authentic relationships and a supportive learning environment are vital to learning, that active learning fosters engagement, critical thinking, and problem solving, and teaching and learning is about making and demonstrating connections."
"Clear presentation, prioritizing the crucial concepts, encouraging and providing space for students to think critically and interact with the material"

"To look at associations between ideas and favorite/best professor and least favorite/worst professor, something following the format of the Harvard Implicit Bias Tests might be very helpful. "
"There are a lot of options out there for teaching to be quite alternative - these are especially valuable - but were not explicitly considered in the questions. For instance, setting students out in a field with an objective to do ...a plant inventory... is likely a very strong teaching experience in comparison to a lecture on ""Plants in California"". "
Thanks for doing this
Quality teaching is not valued very much at UC Davis.
"Practical advice on intellectual life  -- e.g., writing skills, oral presentation, ways of staying current with developing fields, use of library research and other services -- matter _a lot_."
"My best professors were strikingly intellectually honest. They never tried to ""fake it,"" show off or play mind games and one-upmanship in the classroom. Though I received my BA in 1966 and my PhD in 1970, I vividly remember my best (and a couple of the worst) professors AS PEOPLE, much more than I remember the course material. Though I was a Bio major, a couple of my best professors were in very different fields--Geology and PoliSci. The professor who was the single biggest intellectual influence on me was not on my thesis committee, and I never took a formal class from him, but his brilliance and charisma glowed in the dark."
"gender, ethnic and cultural issues.  A good professor must minimize their implicit biases in regards to these issues, and embrace equality and equity in respect to gender, ethnicity and cultural diversity, which maps with learning style diversity."

"This survey is an important effort, but I'm a little concerned about it being biased to give certain answers (and that misleading recommendations will come from this).
The answers are leading (e.g. many of the traits that make a professor ""good"" are somewhat superficial, and don't get to the core of what teaching is, just give more of a sense of personality), and the same qualities being listed for least favorite professor is weird (since wouldn't it be an absence of some of those traits?)
I'd just warn you to be really careful when analyzing and writing about the results- if students and professors don't agree on what makes a good professor- you want to be really careful not to say that one group needs to fit the expectations of the other-- needs more nuance than that"
"I'm not sure that the distinction between ""favorite"" and ""best"" class was very clear. What criteria should be used to decide what is the ""best"" vs. the ""favorite""?"
I think the primary reason I disliked classes was of the professor was so disorganized or unclear that it was very hard to follow or stay engaged in the course material. Maybe this survey was designed to get more at traits beyond basic competence but a clear idea of what the course was about and clear presentation of the material were always key for me.
I didn't fill in what was the characteristic of the worst teacher because everything was positive. the answer will be...a plain boring teacher.
"Hi, Madeline! I didn't see options I wanted in order to describe the best class that I took. It was taught by the late Evan Ringquist at IU (http://viewpoints.iu.edu/policy-briefings/2014/05/22/evan-ringquist-1962-2014/). The material was challenging, to be sure, but not impossibly so, and that wasn't the thing that made the class stellar. Nor was the fact that he followed the syllabus (which he did), was a fair grader (he was), and so on. The class was just amazingly rigorous. It addressed environmental policy in a comprehensive, analytical, big-picture way that clearly reflected a great deal of thought and effort on Ringquist's part to synthesize key ideas and principles. Even though I was just getting into the field, I could that this was a tour de force by a deeply knowledgeable person deeply committed to the field. I used his class as a model for mine for many years. I didn't quite know which radio button this best fit with =)
