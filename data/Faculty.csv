experiential learning
"Bring up-to-date broad information in an accessible way to students and, in turn, require active learning through discussions, assignments, and/or term papers "
Teach like you love it and that the students are important
Inspire the next generation of ecologists
"Teach so that a ""C student"" can understand the material. Challenge the students so that earning an ""A"" requires substantial effort."
"pushing students to excel at new skills, synthesis, integration of knowledge, application of knowledge"
Commit to providing quality education in the same way you want students to commit energy and thought to the class. Set high standards and hold yourself to them as an example.
"Inspire and challenge students to grow intellectually, think critically, and understand something about how the natural world around them works"
My goal is to engage students and share my knowledge in a way that is interesting to them. I also like to engage them during class by asking questions and doing exercises to break up lecture.
"Highly interactive, involving students by asking many questions and fielding/discussing student responses."
"""Stimulating critical analytical and synthetic thought."""
"To provide limited content of large bredth, but in doing so provide the student with the starting point for practicing/figuring the content out for themselves. "
"Research-oriented, critical presentation of primary materials organized so that larger points of theory and concept emerge gradually"
Interaction and hands-on work reinforces both knowledge and critical thinking
"This should be an enjoyable experience for me and the students. "
"Connect concepts and theory with specific research told as stories.  Stay very organized and clear on expectations so they do not become a distraction. Be humble and open to learning from students and making room for students to take the spotlight. Respect and encouragement for those struggling.  "
"clear communication, human connection and time for individual follow up"
"Involve students in critical thinking, asking and answering questions, through a combination of modeling this, showing case studies, and letting students do this themselves in groups"
"teaching students critical thinking- how to absorb the knowledge imparted, synthesize it, and then use it to apply to other questions."

"This survey is an important effort, but I'm a little concerned about it being biased to give certain answers (and that misleading recommendations will come from this).
The answers are leading (e.g. many of the traits that make a professor ""good"" are somewhat superficial, and don't get to the core of what teaching is, just give more of a sense of personality), and the same qualities being listed for least favorite professor is weird (since wouldn't it be an absence of some of those traits?)
I'd just warn you to be really careful when analyzing and writing about the results- if students and professors don't agree on what makes a good professor- you want to be really careful not to say that one group needs to fit the expectations of the other-- needs more nuance than that"
"There are a lot of options out there for teaching to be quite alternative - these are especially valuable - but were not explicitly considered in the questions. For instance, setting students out in a field with an objective to do ...a plant inventory... is likely a very strong teaching experience in comparison to a lecture on ""Plants in California"". "
Thanks for doing this
Quality teaching is not valued very much at UC Davis.
"Practical advice on intellectual life  -- e.g., writing skills, oral presentation, ways of staying current with developing fields, use of library research and other services -- matter _a lot_."
"My best professors were strikingly intellectually honest. They never tried to ""fake it,"" show off or play mind games and one-upmanship in the classroom. Though I received my BA in 1966 and my PhD in 1970, I vividly remember my best (and a couple of the worst) professors AS PEOPLE, much more than I remember the course material. Though I was a Bio major, a couple of my best professors were in very different fields--Geology and PoliSci. The professor who was the single biggest intellectual influence on me was not on my thesis committee, and I never took a formal class from him, but his brilliance and charisma glowed in the dark."
"Hi, Madeline! I didn't see options I wanted in order to describe the best class that I took. It was taught by the late Evan Ringquist at IU (http://viewpoints.iu.edu/policy-briefings/2014/05/22/evan-ringquist-1962-2014/). The material was challenging, to be sure, but not impossibly so, and that wasn't the thing that made the class stellar. Nor was the fact that he followed the syllabus (which he did), was a fair grader (he was), and so on. The class was just amazingly rigorous. It addressed environmental policy in a comprehensive, analytical, big-picture way that clearly reflected a great deal of thought and effort on Ringquist's part to synthesize key ideas and principles. Even though I was just getting into the field, I could that this was a tour de force by a deeply knowledgeable person deeply committed to the field. I used his class as a model for mine for many years. I didn't quite know which radio button this best fit with =)

"gender, ethnic and cultural issues.  A good professor must minimize their implicit biases in regards to these issues, and embrace equality and equity in respect to gender, ethnicity and cultural diversity, which maps with learning style diversity."
